# Description

-- Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy 
for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases.
 Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. 
 In this homework assignment, I created a organized 
 solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
