# Description

>- My goal was to create a command-line center application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
>- The idea was to generate a webpage thats displays a team basic info so that that the user has quick access to their emails and Github profiles
>- The most difficult task during this project was connecting my HTML template to my index.js file
